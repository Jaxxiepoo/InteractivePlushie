# InteractivePlushie

The following code is my self-assigned final project, a challenge I took on to push my limits. I set out with the goal of applying the knowledge gained from my AP Computer Science class. Over the course of two months, I dedicated time to brainstorming, programming, and polishing this supplement. It not only allowed me to independently apply the knowledge I acquired but also served as a platform for improving my programming skills. I take immense pride in my creation and have hopes of remastering it in the future. 

In the code I've written, I've created an interactive virtual plushie with various emotions and reactions to user interactions. The plushie has different elements, such as eyes, horns, and a crown. Through mouse interactions, like clicking on specific parts of the plushie, users can evoke emotions, from happiness and blushing to sadness and protection. Additionally, there's a centerpiece jewel that, when interacted with, can affect the plushie's emotions. The code utilizes functions for different emotional states and keeps track of user interactions in a memory bank, influencing the plushie's responses. It's an engaging and dynamic representation of a virtual character with a range of emotions.
